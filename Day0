My objective in the next 100 days is to improve upon and sharpen my basic coding skills by taking on lots of programming challenges.
I will commit an hour each day to achieve this.
I intend to code early in the morning, around 6.
I am a big fan on J Cole and I hope to meet him by the end of this year.
